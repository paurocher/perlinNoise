NAME
    noise - Noise functions for procedural generation of content
DESCRIPTION
    Contains native code implementations of Perlin improved noise (with
    fBm capabilities) and Perlin simplex noise. Also contains a fast
    "fake noise" implementation in GLSL for execution in shaders.

FUNCTIONS
    pnoise1 = noise1(...)
        noise1(x, octaves=1, persistence=0.5, lacunarity=2.0, repeat=1024, base=0.0)

        1 dimensional perlin improved noise function (see noise3 for more info)

    pnoise2 = noise2(...)
        noise2(x, y, octaves=1, persistence=0.5, lacunarity=2.0, repeatx=1024, repeaty=1024, base=0.0)

        2 dimensional perlin improved noise function (see noise3 for more info)

    pnoise3 = noise3(...)
        noise3(x, y, z, octaves=1, persistence=0.5, lacunarity=2.0repeatx=1024, repeaty=1024, repeatz=1024, base=0.0)

        return perlin "improved" noise value for specified coordinate

        octaves -- specifies the number of passes for generating fBm noise,
        defaults to 1 (simple noise).

        persistence -- specifies the amplitude of each successive octave relative
        to the one below it. Defaults to 0.5 (each higher octave's amplitude
        is halved). Note the amplitude of the first pass is always 1.0.

        lacunarity -- specifies the frequency of each successive octave relative
        to the one below it, similar to persistence. Defaults to 2.0.

        repeatx, repeaty, repeatz -- specifies the interval along each axis when
        the noise values repeat. This can be used as the tile size for creating
        tileable textures

        base -- specifies a fixed offset for the input coordinates. Useful for
        generating different noise textures with the same repeat interval

    snoise2 = noise2(...)
        noise2(x, y, octaves=1, persistence=0.5, lacunarity=2.0, repeatx=None, repeaty=None, base=0.0) return simplex noise value for specified 2D coordinate.

        octaves -- specifies the number of passes, defaults to 1 (simple noise).

        persistence -- specifies the amplitude of each successive octave relative
        to the one below it. Defaults to 0.5 (each higher octave's amplitude
        is halved). Note the amplitude of the first pass is always 1.0.

        lacunarity -- specifies the frequency of each successive octave relative
        to the one below it, similar to persistence. Defaults to 2.0.

        repeatx, repeaty -- specifies the interval along each axis when
        the noise values repeat. This can be used as the tile size for creating
        tileable textures

        base -- specifies a fixed offset for the noise coordinates. Useful for
        generating different noise textures with the same repeat interval

    snoise3 = noise3(...)
        noise3(x, y, z, octaves=1, persistence=0.5, lacunarity=2.0) return simplex noise value for specified 3D coordinate

        octaves -- specifies the number of passes, defaults to 1 (simple noise).

        persistence -- specifies the amplitude of each successive octave relative
        to the one below it. Defaults to 0.5 (each higher octave's amplitude
        is halved). Note the amplitude of the first pass is always 1.0.

        lacunarity -- specifies the frequency of each successive octave relative
        to the one below it, similar to persistence. Defaults to 2.0.

    snoise4 = noise4(...)
        noise4(x, y, z, w, octaves=1, persistence=0.5, lacunarity=2.0) return simplex noise value for specified 4D coordinate

        octaves -- specifies the number of passes, defaults to 1 (simple noise).

        persistence -- specifies the amplitude of each successive octave relative
        to the one below it. Defaults to 0.5 (each higher octave's amplitude
        is halved). Note the amplitude of the first pass is always 1.0.

        lacunarity -- specifies the frequency of each successive octave relative
        to the one below it, similar to persistence. Defaults to 2.0.
